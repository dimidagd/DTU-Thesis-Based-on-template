%TODO DO write about the Thesis, the scope and the results

Maritime Situational Awareness is highly important in maritime operations. Even more so, in the context of autonomous navigation, the portrayal of the surrounding environment it provides is crucial in order for the navigator to assess and make decisions that maximize navigational safety. In this direction, the current thesis presents a target tracking framework, that is by able to robustly and accurately localize moving targets around the own-ship, by fusing data from multiple sensors on board. Such a framework is expected to enhance situational awareness in diverse weather conditions, and is considered a key component in an autonomous maritime vessel's architecture. The performance of the framework is validated through testing on simulated navigation scenarios, as well as on real recorded data captured during sea trials by the ShippingLab team.
