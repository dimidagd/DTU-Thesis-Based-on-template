\chapter{Results}\label{ch:Results}
This chapter presents the results of implementing the algorithms outlined in the previous chapters both in simulated and real data.

\section{Simulations}
Simulations provide a flexible and controllable environment to conduct preliminary assessment of an algorithm. In the context of tracking, the developed simulator allows one to control 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)] 
	\item The number of targets around the own-ship
	\item Different motion models for each simulated target with arbitrary process noise (\Cref{sec:MotionModels}).
	\item Different sensor models for each target (\Cref{sec:ObservationModels}).
	\item Tun-able noise intensities for each sensor
	\item Different refresh rates for each simulated sensors
	\item Artificial outliers/clutter observations generation.
\end{enumerate}
