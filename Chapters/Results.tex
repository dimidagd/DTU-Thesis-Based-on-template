\chapter{Results}
This chapter presents the results of implementing the algorithms outlined in the previous chapters both in simulated and real data.

\section{Simulations}
Simulations provide a flexible and controllable environment to conduct preliminary assessment of an algorithm. In the context of tracking, the developed simulator allows one to control

	\item The number of targets around the own-ship
	\item Different motion models for each simulated target and controllable process noise 
	\item Different sensor models for each target
	\item Controllable noise intensities for each sensor
	\item Different refresh rates for each simulated sensors
	\item Artificial outliers/clutter observations
