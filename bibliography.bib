This paper surveys numerous (especially curvilinear) models and compares their performance using a tracking tasks which includes the fusion of GPS and odometry data with an Unscented Kalman Filter. For evaluation purposes, a highly accurate reference trajectory has been recorded using an RTK-supported DGPS receiver. With this ground truth data, the performance of the models is evaluated in different scenarios and driving situations.},

The backbone for vessel surveillance is represented by the satellite-based Automatic Identification System (S-AIS), which provides important though not comprehensive information about ships in the area. The objective of the Canadian-German research project PASSAGES is to specify the requirements and the modular architecture of a persistent maritime surveillance and risk management system adapted to arctic conditions and focused on the Northwest Passage (NWP). In order to provide a continuous vessel traffic picture in remote and local areas, real and simulated sensors from space borne and ground based platforms besides S-AIS are taken into account. The capabilities of such multi-sensor surveillance solutions in enhancing the MDA are demonstrated over two selected operationally relevant scenarios. A key element to achieve this, are robust multisource tracking and fusion algorithms able to cope with different heterogeneous and potentially delayed, imprecise or misaligned sensor data.},
